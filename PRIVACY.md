## Our Privacy Policy

We get it – privacy is important. That's why we've designed this Chrome extension to be as privacy-friendly as possible.

Here's the deal:

- **We don't collect any of your personal data.** That means no names, no emails, no browsing history – nothing that could identify you.
- **This extension only talks to your own Grimoire API instance.** It doesn't send any data to third-parties or any mysterious servers.
- **We won't track how you use the extension.** We want you to have full control over your experience.

## Keeping it Simple

We believe privacy policies shouldn't be complicated. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us at [your support email].

## Changes

We might update this policy if we make changes to the extension. We'll let you know if that happens!
